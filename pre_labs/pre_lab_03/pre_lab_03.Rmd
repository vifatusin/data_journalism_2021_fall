ppp_maryland_loans <- read_csv("ppp_loans_md.csv.zip", guess_max=195865)
```

### Task 5: Examine the data with glimpse
**Task** Run the following codeblock to glimpse the data.  What data type is the "amount" field?  What data type is the "name" field? What data type is the id column? Answer below.
**Answer** For the "amount" field, they are numbers (dbl). For the "name field" they are characters (chr). For the "id" column, they are numbers (dbl). 
```{r}
glimpse(ppp_maryland_loans)
```
### Task 6: Change the "id" field data type

```{r}
ppp_maryland_loans <- ppp_maryland_loans %>%
  mutate(id = as.character(id))

glimpse(ppp_maryland_loans)
```

### Task 7: Examine the franchise column for missing values.
**Task** Run the following codeblock to group by franchise_name, count the numer of loans, then sort from highest to lowest on count. How many loans are there where franchise_name is NA? How many loans are there where the franchise_name is "Subway"? Answer below.
**Answer**: For franchise names under NA, the number of loans wre 192,959. There were no loans under Subway.

```{r}

ppp_maryland_loans %>%
  group_by(franchise_name) %>%
  summarise(
    count=n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
```
### Task 8: Examine the forgiveness_amount column for missing values.
**Task** Run the following codeblock to group by forgiveness_amount, count the numer of loans, then sort from highest to lowest on count. How many loans are there where forgiveness_amount is NA? Answer below.
**Answer**: The amount of loans where tjhe forgiveness_amount is NA is 135,073.

```{r}

ppp_maryland_loans %>%
  group_by(forgiveness_amount) %>%
  summarise(
    count=n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
```

### Task 9: Examine the forgiveness_date column for missing values.
**Task** Run the following codeblock to group by forgiveness_date, count the numer of loans, then sort from highest to lowest on count and filter to only show NA values. How many loans are there where forgiveness_date is NA? Is it the same as the number for forgiveness_amount? Answer below.
**Answer** 135,073. Yes, it is the same.

```{r}

ppp_maryland_loans %>%
  group_by(forgiveness_date) %>%
  summarise(
    count=n()
  ) %>%
  filter(is.na(forgiveness_date)) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
```
### Task 10: Examine forgiveness_date and forgiveness_amount together
**Task** Run the following codeblock to group by forgiveness_date and forgiveness_amount, count the number of loans, then sort from highest to lowest on count and filter to only show NA values. How many loans are there where forgiveness_date and forgiveness_amount is NA? Is it the same as the number for forgiveness_amount and forgiveness_amount run separately in the codeblocks above? What can you conclude from Answer below.
**Answer**: 135,073. Yes, they're all the same. Since the same amount keeps coming up, they're possibly loans that have not been forgiven. 
```{r}
ppp_maryland_loans %>%
  group_by(forgiveness_amount, forgiveness_date) %>%
  summarise(
    count=n()
  ) %>%
  filter(is.na(forgiveness_date)) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

Group by the new "month_year_approved" column, count, and sort by "month_year_approved". How many loans are there in the data for October 2020? Answer below.
**Answer** No data comes up for October 2020. 
```{r}
ppp_maryland_loans %>%
  mutate(month_year_approved = floor_date(date_approved, "month")) %>%

   summarise(
    count=n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(month_year_approved)
```

### Task 14: Check for suspicious outliers
**Task** Run the following codeblock to find the largest and smallest loans in the data, by using summarise() without grouping. How much is the largest loan for? How much is the smallest loan for? Are either of these suspicious to you? Why or why not? Answer below.
**Answer** The largest loan is for 10000000 and the smallest loan is for 6. It is a little suspicious because what would $6 do, but also, why would a company need 10 million? And where is it going? It's also a very vast difference between the two numbers. 
```{r}

ppp_maryland_loans %>%
  summarise(max_amount = max(amount),
            min_amount= min(amount))
```


### Task 15: Look at smallest loans

### Task 5: Examine the data table
**Task** Run the following codeblock to examine the data. Name three problems the book chapter says exist in this data set that could prevent us from answering questions?  Answer below
**Answer** There are two rows that are exactly the same. There are multiple variations of Ritchie Hwy, which shows inconsistencies in the street address field. The amount column is also a seen as character data set, rather than a number, so it makes math on it difficult to do. 

```{r}
arnold_md_loans
```

### Task 6: Use clean_names()
**Task** Run the following codeblock to use the clean_names() function from janitor to standardize column names. How does the function change the name of the column "1_id"? Answer below.

```{r}
# cleaning function
cleaned_arnold_md_loans <- arnold_md_loans %>%
  clean_names()

# display the cleaned dataset
cleaned_arnold_md_loans
```

### Task 7: Use rename()
**Task** Run the following codeblock to use the clean_names() function from janitor to standardize column names and then use rename() to change the "x1_id" column.


```{r}
# cleaning function
cleaned_arnold_md_loans <- arnold_md_loans %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  rename(id = x1_id)

# display the cleaned dataset
cleaned_arnold_md_loans


```

### Task 8: Try summarizing the amount column
**Task** Run the following codeblock to attempt to add up the amount of all loans. What does the error say when you run this code? What do you think it means? Answer below.
**Answer** The error says that there is a "problem with `summarise()` column `total_amount`. ℹ `total_amount = sum(amount)`." It also says that there is an "invalid 'type' (character) of argument."

```{r}
# cleaning function
total_arnold_md_loans <- cleaned_arnold_md_loans %>%
  summarise(total_amount = sum(amount))

# display the cleaned dataset
total_arnold_md_loans


```
### Task 9: Change data type for amount
**Task** Run the following codeblock to attempt to change the datatype for the amount field to a number. What is the new data type (three letter code) for amount? Answer below.
